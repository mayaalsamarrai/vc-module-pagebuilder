# vc-module-pagebuilder

## Overview

The Pagebuilder allows creating static pages from blocks and editing them using a visual editor.

Each page consists of several different blocks. The blocks view and settings depend on web page requirements.

The page is created in the builder as a list of blocks with specific settings applied to each block. All data are saved in a Json file format.

## Subsystem component description

The builder is consisted of two main subsystems:

1. Script with Creating logics;
1. Script with Preview visualization logics.

The Builder runs on admin side so that it can receive data from VC platform and save changes made during editing of pages and themes.

The Preview script runs on Storefront, as only Storefront 'knows' which templates should be used to generate the html.

The scripts 'communicate' with each other via messages- [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage)
